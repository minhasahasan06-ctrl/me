### Real-World Workflow Example

**Scenario**: Managing Type 2 Diabetes

1. **Profile Setup**
   - Add "Type 2 Diabetes" to medical history
   - List Metformin in current medications
   - Set goal: "Improve blood sugar control"

2. **Upload Documents**
   - Upload recent A1C test results
   - Upload blood glucose log
   - AI analysis highlights trends

3. **Create Follow-ups**
   - Daily: "Check morning blood glucose"
   - Weekly: "Review blood sugar patterns"
   - Monthly: "Weight and exercise progress"

4. **Chat Interaction**
   ```
   You: "My morning glucose was 145. Is this concerning?"
   AI: "Based on your recent A1C results and this morning's 
        reading of 145 mg/dL, you're slightly above target 
        (usually 80-130 before meals). Consider reviewing 
        your dinner carb intake and ensure you're taking 
        your Metformin as prescribed. Let's track this 
        pattern over the next week with your daily check-ins."
