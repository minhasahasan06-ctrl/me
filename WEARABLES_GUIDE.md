### API Integration Points (For Production)

```python
# Example: Real Apple Health Integration
def sync_apple_health(device_id, user_auth_token):
    # Connect to HealthKit
    # Fetch heart rate, steps, sleep data
    # Store in health_metrics table
    pass

# Example: Real Fitbit Integration
def sync_fitbit(device_id, access_token):
    # OAuth with Fitbit API
    # Pull activity and sleep data
    # Normalize and store metrics
    pass
```
