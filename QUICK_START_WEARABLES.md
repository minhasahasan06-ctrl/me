## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### "Not authenticated" error
**Fix**: Make sure you're logged in. Go to /login if needed.

### Device won't connect
**Fix**: 
- Check device name is filled in
- Select a device type
- Try refreshing the page

### No data after sync
**Fix**:
- Refresh the page
- Try syncing again
- Check browser console for errors

### AI insights not showing
**Fix**:
- Ensure you synced data at least once
- Refresh the insights section
- Check Google API key is configured in backend

### Chat doesn't use wearable data
**Fix**:
- Sync your device first
- Ask specific questions about metrics
- Give the AI a moment to process

## Demo Data Details

When you sync in demo mode, the system generates:
- **24 heart rate readings** (one per hour, 60-95 bpm)
- **24 step counts** (cumulative throughout day)
- **1 sleep record** (6-9 hours)
- **1 calorie record** (1,800-2,800 kcal)
- **1 SpO2 reading** (95-100%)

This simulates a full day of wearable device data.

## Next Steps

### Explore More Features
1. **Set up health profile** (Profile page)
   - Add age, medical history, medications
   - AI uses this for even more personalized advice

2. **Upload medical documents** (Documents page)
   - Lab results, prescriptions
   - AI analyzes alongside wearable data

3. **Create follow-ups** (Follow-ups page)
   - Daily medication reminders
   - Exercise goals
   - Track consistency

### Connect Multiple Devices
- Add a fitness band

## API Endpoints for Testing

### Test with cURL:

**Get Devices:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/wearables/devices \
  --cookie-jar cookies.txt \
  --cookie cookies.txt
```

**Connect Device:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/wearables/devices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device_name":"Test Watch","device_type":"smartwatch"}' \
  --cookie-jar cookies.txt \
  --cookie cookies.txt
```

**Sync Data:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/wearables/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device_id":"YOUR_DEVICE_ID"}' \
  --cookie-jar cookies.txt \
  --cookie cookies.txt
```

## Production Deployment

### For Real Device Integration

1. **Apple HealthKit**:
   - Implement OAuth flow
   - Request health data permissions
   - Use HealthKit API to fetch metrics

2. **Google Fit**:
   - Set up Google Fit API credentials
   - Implement OAuth 2.0
   - Query fitness data API

3. **Fitbit**:
   - Register app on Fitbit Dev Portal
   - Get OAuth credentials
   - Use Fitbit Web API

4. **Replace sync simulation** in `backend/app.py`:
```python
# Current (demo):
def sync_wearable_data():
    # Generates simulated data
    
# Production:
def sync_wearable_data():
    device_type = get_device_type(device_id)
    if device_type == 'apple_watch':
        return sync_apple_health(device_id)
    elif device_type == 'fitbit':
        return sync_fitbit(device_id)
    # etc.
```
